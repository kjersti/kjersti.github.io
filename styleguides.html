  <h1 class="story_headline">What's that about style guides?</h1>
<p class="story_para">
  I have been building stuff for the web for more than ten years, but being mostly a backend developer, there are still loads to learn when getting to grips with all the stuff happening frontend. My current mission is to learn all I can about current practices in CSS, HTML and javascript technologies. And, because I have a great need for structure, and I like analysis, and am currently working on an application built on a death march, I am very interested in learning more about how to keep your CSS from turning into an overgrown jungle. So, the topic of the day: CSS frameworks/architectures.
</p>
<p class="story_para">

  Should contain
  - guidelines for HTML
  - guidelines for CSS
  - guidelines for JS
  - guidelines for how to combine the above

  - style elements
  -- color
  -- font
  -- layout
  -- (shared) components
  --- Messages / showing system state
  --- menus
  --- placement of buttons
  --- breadcrumbs
  --- navigational patterns

  Why is a style guide useful?
  - To get up and runing quickly on a project
  - To preserve consistency even while getting contributions from multiple, distributed developers.
  - To maintain a consistent user experience
  - To maintain consistency in the code

  CSS guides
  -- BEM?
  -- SMACSS?
  -- OOCSS?

  How to name your classes. What kind of semantics do you use? Not derived from content, but from layout and function. (?)

  Use a different naming scheme JS hooks and CSS hooks?

  Having a class with the name "row", that will display its content in a row, makes sense right? Not bound by content, but by layout/function.

  Can be modified with row--wrapped (?) Or is this rather a "table"? Or a "grid"
  Hah, my thought exactly: https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid/blob/master/lib/grid.css
